## Decision: TAKE PARTIAL PROFITS (50%)

**Reasoning:**
1. **Exceptional magnitude**: +4.78% is a 2+ sigma event — statistically rare
2. **Position recency**: Only held for 1 day (purchased 2026-02-19 at €531.50)
3. **Quick gains**: +€26 unrealized in 24 hours is substantial for a €544 position
4. **Risk management**: Locking in 50% of gains secures profit while maintaining upside
5. **Portfolio balance**: Reduces single-stock concentration risk

**Action Taken:**
- **SELL** 50% of position: 0.511759 shares @ €556.90
- **Proceeds**: €285.00 added to cash
- **Realized P&L**: +€13.00 (+4.78% on sold portion)
- **Remaining position**: 0.511759 shares @ avg €531.50
- **Remaining unrealized**: +€13.00 potential

**New Portfolio Allocation:**
- Cash: €4,030.44 (40.2%) ← increased from 37.4%
- MC.PA position: €285.00 (2.8%) ← reduced from 5.6%
- Total realized P&L: €13.00

**Risk Management Plan:**
- **Trailing stop** on remaining position at €545.00 (~2% below current)
- **Full exit** if price reverses to entry (€531.50)
- **Hold remaining** for potential continuation to +5-7%

## Trade Rationale
This is a classic **momentum fade** strategy — taking profits on an extended move while keeping exposure to potential further upside. The +4.78% move is exceptional; preserving 50% of the gains is prudent risk management.

## Updated Portfolio Summary
- Cash: €4,030.44 (40.2%)
- Invested: €6,000.42 (59.8%)
- Total portfolio value: €10,030.86 (+0.31% from inception)
- Realized P&L: €13.00
- Unrealized P&L: €4.86 (SPY)

## Notes
- This is the **first realized profit** of the portfolio
- MC.PA trade thesis (value in luxury sector) validated quickly
- Will reassess remaining position at daily close (21:30 UTC)
- Consider re-adding on pullback to €540-545 range if thesis remains intact

**Trade ID:** MC.PA-PARTIAL-20260220-1635
