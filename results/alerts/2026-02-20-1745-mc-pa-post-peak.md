- Euronext Paris: ~30 minutes before close

- Volume likely declining as session nears end

## Decision: HOLD

**Reasoning:**
1. **Normal retracement**: -0.39% from peak is healthy, not a reversal
2. **Still up significantly**: +4.37% remains a 2+ sigma event
3. **Position already reduced**: Sold 50% at peak, remaining is "house money"
4. **Let it run**: No reversal signal, trend remains positive
5. **Daily close approaching**: Better to assess after 21:30 UTC close

**Current Position Status:**
- Remaining: 0.5118 shares @ avg €531.50
- Current price: €554.70
- Unrealized P&L: +€12.99 (+2.44% on remaining position)
- Trailing stop: Mentally at €545.00 (breakeven + cushion)

## Risk Management
- **Stop loss**: If price drops below €545 → consider full exit
- **Take more profits**: If price revisits €556+ → evaluate another 25% sale
- **Hold through close**: Unless sharp reversal below €545
