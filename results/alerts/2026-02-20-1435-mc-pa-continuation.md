## Analysis
- **Second alert** on same ticker within 2h20min
- Movement now at **+2.75%**, exceeding 30-day maximum (2.67%)
- This is a **new 30-day high** for daily movement
- Price action shows sustained buying pressure, not a spike

## Market Context
- Time: 14:35 UTC (15:35 CET) — mid-afternoon European session
- Euronext Paris: Still active, ~2.5 hours before close
- Momentum continues, possibly driven by sector rotation or news

## Decision: HOLD

**Reasoning:**
1. While movement is now at 30-day extreme (+2.75%), it's not a panic-level spike
2. Sustained upward move suggests real buying interest, not just noise
3. Position is modest (~5.6% of portfolio) — single-stock risk is contained
4. Taking profits now would be reactive; better to wait for daily close context
5. No reversal signal yet — price continues to make new intraday highs

**Risk Management:**
- If price reverses below €540 (support) → consider trailing stop
- If price reaches +5% (+€558) → evaluate taking partial profits
- Current unrealized gain: +€14.96 (+2.75%)

**Plan:**
- Continue monitoring
- Await daily close at 21:30 UTC for full LLM analysis
- Update stop-loss mental to breakeven (€531.50) if price consolidates above €545

## Updated Portfolio Summary
- Cash: €3,745.44 (37.4%)
- MC.PA position value: €559.00 (5.6%)
- Total portfolio value: €10,019.60 (+0.20% from inception)
- Unrealized P&L on MC.PA: +€14.96

## Note
This is the **second intraday alert** for MC.PA. The stock is showing unusual strength. Worth investigating any sector news (luxury goods, China demand, earnings) during daily analysis.
